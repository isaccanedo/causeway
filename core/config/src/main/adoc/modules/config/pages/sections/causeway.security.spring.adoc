[[causeway.security.spring.allow-csrf-filters]]
causeway.security.spring. +
allow-csrf-filters

| 
| The framework on initialization by default disables any \{@code CsrfFilter}(s) it finds with _Spring Security_ registered filters.

Setting this option to \{@literal true} allows \{@code CsrfFilter}(s) to be configured. Yet EXPERIMENTAL. @see ``CsrfFilter`` @see "https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-registered-filters"
