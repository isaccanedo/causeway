This module provides an implementation of the internal `_ProxyFactoryService` domain service, used to synthesise object proxies dynamically.

Under the covers the link:https://bytebuddy.net/#/[Byte Buddy] library is used.

The main user of this functionality is the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[] domain service, which creates a proxy in order to intercept calls to a wrapped domain object.
