As well as providing a sign-in screen, the Wicket viewer also provides the ability for users to self-register.
By and large this operates outside of Apache Causeway' security mechanisms; indeed the various pages (sign-up, sign-up verification, password reset) are all rendered _without_ there being any current user session.
These pages all "reach inside" Apache Causeway framework in order to actually do their stuff.

User registration is only available if the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/UserRegistrationService.adoc[UserRegistrationService] is configured; this is used by the framework to actually create new instances of the user as accessed by the corresponding (Shiro) realm.

Because Shiro realms are pluggable, the Apache Causeway framework does not provide default implementations of this service.
However, if you are using the xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension], then this module _does_ provide an implementation (that, as you might expect, creates new "user" domain entities).
