From link:http://causeway.markmail.org/thread/ctppmtcbsf4iskzi[this thread] on the Apache Causeway users mailing list:

* _I am trying to internationalize the label descriptions of form actions, eg those in `ActionParametersFormPanel`.
Referencing those via their message id inside a .po file didn't work either.
Can this be done?_


Yes, it _is_ possible to internationalize both the Wicket viewer's labels as well as the regular translations of the domain object metadata using the `.po` translation files as supported by the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/i18n/TranslationService.adoc[TranslationService].

Full details of the ``msgId``s that must be added to the `translations.po` file can be found in xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[i18n] section of the xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc[beyond the basics] guide.
