The Wicket viewer allows you to customize the GUI in several (progressively more sophisticated) ways.

In the xref:vw:ROOT:customisation.adoc[customisation] chapter described tweaking the UI using xref:vw:ROOT:customisation.adoc#custom-css[custom CSS] and  xref:vw:ROOT:customisation.adoc#custom-javascript[custom JavaScript].

In this chapter we have a number of more heavy-weight approaches:

** by writing a xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#custom-bootstrap-theme[custom bootstrap theme]
** by xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#replacing-page-elements[replacing elements of the page] using the `ComponentFactory` interface
** by implementing xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#custom-pages[replacement page implementations] for the standard page types
