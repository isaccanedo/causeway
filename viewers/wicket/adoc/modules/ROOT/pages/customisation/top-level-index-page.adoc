If the user visits the root of the webapp (eg http://localhost:8080[]), then the top-level `index.html` page is shown.
Spring Boot specifies that the location of this `index.html` is in the `static` package, typically under `src/main/resources` in the `webapp` module.

This is a static file that typically has hyperlinks to the available resources available (eg the Wicket viewer at `/wicket/`, the Swagger UI is bound to `/swagger-ui`, the Restful at `/restful/`).

If instead you want to redirect users directly to the Wicket viewer, then this file should contain simply:

.about/index.html
[source,html]
----
<html>
<head>
    <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="0; URL=wicket/"/>
</head>
</html>
