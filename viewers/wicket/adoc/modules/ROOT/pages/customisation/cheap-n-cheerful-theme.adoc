The application name (as defined by xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.wicket.adoc#causeway.viewer.wicket.application.name[causeway.viewer.wicket.application.name]) is also used in sanitized form as the CSS class in a `<div>` that wraps all the rendered content of every page.

For example, if the application name is "ToDo App", then the `<div>` generated is:

[source,html]
----
<div class="todo-app">
    ...
</div>
----

You can therefore use this CSS class as a way of building your own "theme" for the various elements of the wicket viewer pages.

Alternatively you could "do it properly" and create your xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#custom-bootstrap-theme[own Bootstrap theme], as described in the xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc[extending] chapter.
