By default the Wicket viewer will display the application name top-left in the header menu.
This can be changed to display a png logo instead.

== Screenshots

The screenshot below shows an app with a 'brand logo' image in its header:

image::brand-logo/brand-logo.png[width="750px"]

A custom brand logo (typically larger) can also be specified for the signin page:

image::brand-logo/brand-logo-signin.png[width="750px"]



To configure, set the xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.wicket.adoc#causeway.viewer.wicket.application.brand-logo-signin[causeway.viewer.wicket.application.brand-logo-signin] and xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.wicket.adoc#causeway.viewer.wicket.application.brand-logo-header[causeway.viewer.wicket.application.brand-logo-header] config properties:

[source,properties]
----
causeway.wicket.viewer.application.brand-logo-signin=images/todoapp-logo-signin.png
causeway.wicket.viewer.application.brand-logo-header=images/todoapp-logo-header.png
----

These files are resolved relative to the `static` package in `src/main/resources`.
Alternatively an absolute URL can be specified.

In terms of sizing:

* for the signin image, a size of 400x100 works well.
* for the header image, a size of 160x40 works well.


You may also wish to tweak the xref:refguide:config:application-specific/application-css.adoc[application.css].
For example, a logo with height 40px works well with the following:

[source,css]
----
.navbar-brand img {
    margin-top: -5px;
    margin-left: 5px;
}
