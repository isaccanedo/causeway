The Wicket viewer provides some support such that an Apache Causeway application can be embedded within a host webapp, for example within an iframe.
Currently this support consists simply of being able to suppress the header and/or footer.

== Screenshots

For example, the regular view is:

image::embedded-view/regular.png[width="720px"]


With the header and footer both suppressed only the main content is shown:

image::embedded-view/no-header-no-footer.png[width="720px"]


It is also possible to suppress just the header, or just the footer.



== Request parameters

To suppress the header, add the following as a request parameter:

[source,ini]
----
causeway.no.header
----

and to suppress the header, add the following as a request parameter:

[source,ini]
----
causeway.no.footer
----

For example,

[source,ini]
----
http://localhost:8080/wicket/entity/TODO:0?causeway.no.header&causeway.no.footer
----
