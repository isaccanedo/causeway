This section describes how to include the Restful Objects viewer's module and set its configuration properties.


include::docs:mavendeps:partial$setup-and-configure-mavendeps-webapp.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleViewerRestfulObjectsViewer.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----


== Configuration Properties

The xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration Guide] includes a xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc[section] for the Restful Objects viewer.


=== Standard

Standard configuration properties:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.base-uri[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.base-uri]

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.authentication.strategy-class-name[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.authentication.strategy-class-name]
+
Security is discussed in more detail xref:security.adoc[here].

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.strict-accept-checking[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.strict-accept-checking]

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.honor-ui-hints[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.honor-ui-hints]



[#deprecated]
=== Deprecated

These configuration properties that can be used to suppress or simplify the default RO-spec representations.

These configuration properties pre-date the support for the link:content-negotiation/simplified-representations/[Apache Causeway profile], and are limited by the fact that they are global configuration settings, so cannot be influenced on a request-by-request basis (as is the case with the `Accept` header used for the Apache Causeway profile).
They have therefore been deprecated, and may be removed in the future.

Nevertheless, those configuration properties are:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-extensions[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-extensions]

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-disabled-reason[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-disabled-reason]

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.object-property-values-only[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.object-property-values-only]


[NOTE]
====
If these configuration settings are set in conjunction with using the xref:vro:ROOT:content-negotiation/apache-causeway-v2-profile.adoc#apache-causeway-v2-profile-simplified-representation[Apache Causeway profile], then the special `$$ro` property in the representations with reflect these settings.
