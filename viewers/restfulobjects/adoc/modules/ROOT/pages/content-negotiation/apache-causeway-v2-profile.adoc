The representations defined by the RO spec are very rich and enable complex client-side applications to be built.
However, their sophistication can be an impediment to their use if one wishes to write a simple app using third-party components that expect to consume much simpler representations.

Apache Causeway also provides support for its own simplified representation for the most commonly-used representations.
This is implemented using the xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationService.adoc[ContentNegotiationService] described in the
xref:vro:ROOT:content-negotiation.adoc[architecture] chapter.
