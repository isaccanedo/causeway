The JPA/EclipseLink object store enables domain objects to be persisted to relational databases.
The object store is implemented using the link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/[EclipseLink] ORM, using the link:https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317[JPA] API.
EclipseLink is the reference implementation for JPA.
