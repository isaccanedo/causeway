Allows for programmatic generation of ascii-doc representing document models.

NOTE: The _AsciiDoc_ name is trademarked by the https://www.eclipse.org/[_Eclipse Foundation_].
This project is *not* part of the specification effort for _AsciiDoc_ under the
_AsciiDoc Working Group_. See https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/asciidoc-language[]
and https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/asciidoc-wg[]. However, we are happy to
help with transfer of source code, if any project (under the umbrella of the
_AsciiDoc Working Group_) is willing to take over.

== Usage

Say we have a list of employees, which we want to express as ascii-doc table.

[source,java]
----
public static class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String firstName;
    private String surName;
    ...
}

List<Employee> employees = List.of(
        new Employee(1, "Alice", "Wonder"),
        new Employee(2, "Bob", "Uncle")
);
----

Lets generate a _Document_ model programmatically, then print it to _System.out_.

[source,java]
----

import org.apache.causeway.valuetypes.asciidoc.builder.AsciiDocWriter;
import static org.apache.causeway.valuetypes.asciidoc.builder.AsciiDocFactory.*;

...

Document doc = doc();
doc.setTitle("Hello World");

Block block = block(doc);
block.getLines().add("A simple block corresponds to a normal paragraph.");

Table table = table(doc);
table.setTitle("Employees");
table.setAttribute("cols", "1m,3,3", true);
table.setAttribute("header-option", "", true);

Row headRow = headRow(table);

cell(table, headRow, "ID");
cell(table, headRow, "Firstname");
cell(table, headRow, "Surname");

for(Employee employee : employees) {

    Row row = row(table);
    cell(table, row, "" + employee.getId());
    cell(table, row, employee.getFirstName());
    cell(table, row, employee.getSurName());
}

System.out.println(AsciiDocWriter.toString(doc));

----

ascii-doc syntax generated:

[source]
----
= Hello World

A simple block corresponds to a normal paragraph.

.Employees
[cols="1m,3,3", options="header"]
|===
|ID |Firstname |Surname

|1
|Alice
|Wonder

|2
|Bob
|Uncle
|===
----

which renders as

==== Hello World

A simple block corresponds to a normal paragraph.

.Employees
[cols="1m,3,3", options="header"]
|===
|ID |Firstname |Surname

|1
|Alice
|Wonder

|2
|Bob
|Uncle
|===

== Install

Using Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.valuetypes</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-valuetypes-asciidoc-builder</artifactId>
</dependency>
