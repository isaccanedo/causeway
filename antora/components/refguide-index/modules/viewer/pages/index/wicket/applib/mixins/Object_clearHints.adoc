Provides the ability for the end-user to discard UI hints so that the object is rendered in its initial state:

When a domain object is rendered the end-user can select different tabs, and for collections can sort the columns, navigate to second pages, or select different views of collections. If the user revisits that object, the Wicket viewer (at least) will remember these hints and render the domain object in the same state.

These rendering hints are also included if the user copies the URL using the anchor link (to right hand of the object's title).

This mixin - contributed to `java.lang.Object` and therefore to all domain objects - provides the ability for the end user to clear any hints that might have been set for the domain object being rendered.
