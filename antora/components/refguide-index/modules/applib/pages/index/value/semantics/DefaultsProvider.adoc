Provides a mechanism for providing a default value for an object.

This interface is used in two complementary ways:

* As one option, it allows objects to take control of their own default values, by implementing directly. However, the instance is used as a factory for itself. The framework will instantiate an instance, invoke the appropriate method method, and use the returned object. The instantiated instance itself will be discarded.

Whatever the class that implements this interface, it must also expose either a `public` no-arg constructor, or (for implementations that also are `Facet` s) a `public` constructor that accepts a single `FacetHolder` . This constructor allows the framework to instantiate the object reflectively.
