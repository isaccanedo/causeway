Mixin that provides the ability to download the XSD schema for a view model can be downloaded as XML.

Requires that the view model is a JAXB view model, and implements the xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/dto/Dto.adoc[Dto] marker interface.

If the domain object's JAXB annotations reference only a single XSD schema then this will return that XML text as a xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Clob.adoc[Clob] of that XSD. If there are multiple XSD schemas referenced then the action will return a zip of those schemas, wrapped up in a xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Blob.adoc[Blob] .
