== Implementations

This is an SPI.

NOTE: If multiple implementations of this service are registered, all will be called.

=== Applib (Log4j2)

The applib provides three simple implementations for different types of objects:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/log/PageRenderDomainObjectLogger.adoc[] (domain entities and view models)
* xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/log/PageRenderCollectionLogger.adoc[] (collections) and
* xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/log/PageRenderValueLogger.adoc[] (value types).

Each of these just logs events as they are received for their particular type of object.
