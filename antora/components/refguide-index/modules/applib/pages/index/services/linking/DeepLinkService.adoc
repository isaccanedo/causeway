A service that returns a web link (`java.net.URI`) to any domain object in one of the framework's viewers.

A typical use case is to generate a clickable link for rendering in an email, PDF, tweet or other communication.

Note that the implementation is specific to the viewer(s). At the time of writing only one implementation is available, for the Wicket viewer.
