This is a utility service to support the usage of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/tablecol/TableColumnOrderService.adoc[TableColumnOrderService] , providing the ability to obtain a zip of each of the `Xxx.columnOrder.txt` files for the specified domain object.

The zip contains:

* DomainClass.columnOrder.txt

- as used for standalone collections of `DomainClass` itself
* DomainClass#collection1.columnOrder.txt

- for `DomainClass` ' collection with id `collection1` .
* ...
* DomainClass#collectionN.columnOrder.txt

- for `DomainClass` ' collection with id `collectionN` .

These should be unzipped and copied in the domain class' package, and then their contents updated to specify the order in which the respective object's properties will be shown in the standalone or parented collections.
