== Usage

If you want to recognize and handle additional exceptions (for example to capture error messages specific to the JDBC driver you might be using), then create an implementation of this SPI for the particular error message, and annotate your implementation as a xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainService.adoc[DomainService].

There are some convenience implementations of the interface to subclass from if required.
