Optional SPI service providing the ability to record errors occurring in the application into an external incident recording system (such as JIRA) and to provide a user-friendly (jargon-free) error message to the end-user, along with incident reference.

The `Ticket` object returned by this service contains a number of elements:

* a user-friendly (jargon-free) error message to be returned and rendered to the end-user
* an optional incident reference (eg a JIRA issue `XXX-1234`).

a URL for an external image. For example, this could be to a comic strip or (as a bit of fun) a picture of a random kitten.
* _missing listitem text_

The information this object can then be sed by the configured viewer, rendered whenever an error occurs. At the time of writing this is supported by the Wicket viewer.
