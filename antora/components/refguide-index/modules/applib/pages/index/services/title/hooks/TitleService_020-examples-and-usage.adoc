== Usage

By way of example, here's some code based on a system for managing government benefits:

[source,java]
----
public class QualifiedAdult {

    private Customer qualifying;

    public String title() {
        return "QA for " + titleService.titleOf(qualifying);
    }

    // ...

    @Inject TitleService titleService;
}
----

In this example, whatever the title of a `Customer`, it is reused within the title of that customer's ``QualifiedAdult`` object.
