Abstract implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/exceprecog/ExceptionRecognizer.adoc[ExceptionRecognizer] that looks exceptions meeting the _Predicate_ supplied in the constructor and, if found anywhere in the causal chain, then returns a non-null message indicating that the exception has been recognized.

If a messaging-parsing _Function_ is provided through the constructor, then the message can be altered. Otherwise the exception's _Throwable#getMessage() message_ is returned as-is.
