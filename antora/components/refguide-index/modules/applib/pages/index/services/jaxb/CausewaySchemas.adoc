Controls whether, when generating _JaxbService#toXsd(Object, CausewaySchemas) XML schemas_ , any of the common Causeway schemas (in the namespace `http://org.apache.causeway.schema` ) should be included or just ignored (and therefore don't appear in the returned map).

The practical benefit of this is that for many DTOs there will only be one other schema, that of the DTO itself. The xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/dto/Dto_downloadXsd.adoc[Dto_downloadXsd] mixin uses this to return that single XSD, rather than generating a ZIP of two schemas (the Causeway schema and the one for the DTO), as it would otherwise; far more convenient when debugging and so on. The Causeway schemas can always bedownloadedfrom the Causeway website.
