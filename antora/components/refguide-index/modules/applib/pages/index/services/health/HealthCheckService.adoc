This SPI service allow runtime infrastructure such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to monitor the app and (potentially) restart it if required.

This SPI service integrates with Spring Boot'sHealthIndicatorSPI, surfaced through theSpring Boot Actuator. It is therefore accessible from the `/actuator/health` endpoint (Spring allows the endpoint URL to be altered or suppressed).

The service, when called, will be within the context of a special internal user ___health_ with the internal role ___health-role_ .
