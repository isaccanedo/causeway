[#callTransactional_TransactionDefinition_Callable]
=== callTransactional(TransactionDefinition, Callable)

Runs given _callable_ with a transactional boundary, where the detailed transactional behavior is governed by given _TransactionDefinition_ _def_ .

[#runTransactional_TransactionDefinition_ThrowingRunnable]
=== runTransactional(TransactionDefinition, ThrowingRunnable)

Runs given _runnable_ with a transactional boundary, where the detailed transactional behavior is governed by given _TransactionDefinition_ _def_ .

[#callTransactional_Propagation_Callable]
=== callTransactional(Propagation, Callable)

Runs given _callable_ with a transactional boundary, where the detailed transactional behavior is governed by given _Propagation_ _propagation_ .

[#runTransactional_Propagation_ThrowingRunnable]
=== runTransactional(Propagation, ThrowingRunnable)

Runs given _runnable_ with a transactional boundary, where the detailed transactional behavior is governed by given _Propagation_ _propagation_ .

More fine grained control is given via _#runTransactional(TransactionDefinition, ThrowingRunnable)_

[#callWithinCurrentTransactionElseCreateNew_Callable]
=== callWithinCurrentTransactionElseCreateNew(Callable)

Runs given _callable_ within an existing transactional boundary, or in the absence of such a boundary, creates a new one.

In other words, support a current transaction, create a new one if none exists.

[#runWithinCurrentTransactionElseCreateNew_ThrowingRunnable]
=== runWithinCurrentTransactionElseCreateNew(ThrowingRunnable)

Runs given _runnable_ within an existing transactional boundary, or in the absence of such a boundary creates a new one.
