== Implementations

This is an SPI, and the framework provides several implementations.

NOTE: If multiple implementations of this service are registered, all will be called.

=== Applib (Log4j2)

The applib provides a simple implementation, xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/log/CommandLogger.adoc[], that just logs events as they are received.

=== Command Log

The xref:userguide:commandlog:about.adoc[] module also provides an implementation, xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/subscriber/CommandSubscriberForCommandLog.adoc[].
This implementation persists an instance of the xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/dom/CommandLogEntry.adoc[] entity for each event.
