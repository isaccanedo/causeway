Format option when generating a layout file (while prototyping).

Once a layout file is in place, its layout data takes precedence over any conflicting layout data from annotations.

[#COMPLETE]
=== COMPLETE

Format that yields a full representation for the `layout.xml` , such that any layout metadata annotations could be removed from the code, without affecting the resulting xref:refguide:applib:index/layout/grid/Grid.adoc[Grid] , when loaded from `layout.xml` .

[#MINIMAL]
=== MINIMAL

Format that yields a minimal representation for the `layout.xml` , such that layout annotations are required in code to at least 'bind' the properties/collections/actions to their regions (groups and tabs).

In other words: the `layout.xml` is used only to specify the positioning of the groups and tabs.
