== Implementation

This is an abstract class with two concrete subclasses

* `ActionInvocation` represents the execution of an action being invoked:
+
[source,java]
----
public class ActionInvocation extends Execution {
    public List<Object> getArgs();                  // <.>
}
----

<.> The objects passed in as the arguments to the action's parameters.
Any of these could be `null`.

* `PropertyEdit` represents the execution of a property being edited:
=
[source,java]
----
public class PropertyEdit extends Execution {
    public Object getNewValue();                    // <.>
}
----
<.> The object used as the new value of the property.
Could be `null` if the property is being cleared.
