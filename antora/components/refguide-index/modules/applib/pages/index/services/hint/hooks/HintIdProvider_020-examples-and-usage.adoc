== Usage Example

For example, suppose that there's a view model that wraps a `Customer` and its ``Order``s.
For this view model the `Customer` represents the logical identity.
This view model might therefore be implemented as follows:

[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement("customerAndOrders")
@XmlAccessType(FIELD)
public class CustomerAndOrders implements HintStore.HintIdProvider {

    @Getter @Setter
    private Customer customer;

    // ...

    @Programmatic
    public String hintId() {
        bookmarkService.bookmarkFor(getCustomer()).toString();
    }

    @XmlTransient
    @Inject BookmarkService bookmarkService;
}
----
