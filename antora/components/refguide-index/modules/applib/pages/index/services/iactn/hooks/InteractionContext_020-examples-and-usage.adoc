== Usage Notes

Typically domain objects will have little need to interact with the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] and xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] directly.
The services are used within the framework however, primarily to support the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] SPI, and to emit domain events over the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/eventbus/EventBusService.adoc[EventBusService].
