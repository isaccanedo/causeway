[#send_EmailRegistrationEvent]
=== send(EmailRegistrationEvent)

Sends an email to verify an email address as part of the initial user registration

[#send_PasswordResetEvent]
=== send(PasswordResetEvent)

Sends an email to reset a password for an already-registered user

[#isConfigured_]
=== isConfigured()

Whether this service has been configured and thus available for use.

If this returns false then it is _not_ valid to call _#send(EmailRegistrationEvent)_ (and doing so will result in an _IllegalStateException_ being thrown).
