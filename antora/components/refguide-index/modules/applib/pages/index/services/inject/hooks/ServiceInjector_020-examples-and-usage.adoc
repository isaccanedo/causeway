== Usage

The primary use case is to instantiate domain objects using a regular constructor, and then using the service to set up any dependencies.

For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer cust = serviceInjector.injectServicesInto(
                    new Customer("Freddie", "Mercury"));
repositoryService.persist(cust);
----
