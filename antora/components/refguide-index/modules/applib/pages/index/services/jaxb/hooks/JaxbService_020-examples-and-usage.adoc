== Usage within the framework

This service is provided as a convenience for applications, but is also used internally by the framework to marshall xref:refguide:applib-ant:XmlRootElement.adoc[@XmlRootElement]-annotated
xref:userguide:ROOT:view-models.adoc[view models].

The functionality to download XML and XSD schemas is also exposed in the UI through mixins of the xref:applib-classes:mixees-and-mixins.adoc#Dto[Dto] interface.
