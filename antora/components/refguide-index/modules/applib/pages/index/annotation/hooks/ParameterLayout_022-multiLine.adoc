The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/ParameterLayout.adoc#multiLine[multiLine()] element specifies that the text field for a string parameter should span multiple lines.
It is ignored for other parameter types.

If set > 1 (as would normally be the case), then the default xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/ParameterLayout.adoc#labelPosition[labelPosition] defaults to `TOP` (rather than `LEFT`, as would normally be the case).

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class BugReport {

    public BugReport updateStepsToReproduce(
            @ParameterLayout(
                numberOfLines=10
            )
            final String steps) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
