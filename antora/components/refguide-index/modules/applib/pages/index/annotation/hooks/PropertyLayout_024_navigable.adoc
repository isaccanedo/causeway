The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#navigable[navigable()] element allows to specify a domain object's (or view's) navigable parent, as utilized by the 'Where am I' feature.

For example, suppose:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class Company {
    // ...
}
----

then:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@DomainObject
public class Employee {

    @PropertyLayout(navigable=Navigable.PARENT)
    @Getter @Setter
    private Company myCompany;

    // ...
}
----

This points up to the ``Employee``'s parent ``Company``.

For further details on using a navigable tree-structure, see xref:vw:ROOT:features.adoc#where-am-i[Where am I] in the user guide.
