The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.adoc#paged[paged()] element specifies the number of rows to display in a standalone collection, as returned from an action invocation.

[WARNING]
====
The xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] currently does not support paging.
The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)] _does_ support paging, but note that the paging is performed client-side rather than server-side.

We therefore recommend that large collections should instead be modelled as actions (to allow filtering to be applied to limit the number of rows).
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(paged=15)
public class Order {
    // ...
}
----

It is also possible to specify a global default for the page size of standalone collections, using the xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.applib.adoc#causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object-layout.paged[causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object-layout.paged] configuration property.
