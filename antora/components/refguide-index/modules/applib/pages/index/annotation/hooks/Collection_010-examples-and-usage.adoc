== Examples

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class DependenciesChangedEvent
            extends CollectionDomainEvent<ToDoItem, ToDoItem> { } // <1>
    @Collection(
        domainEvent=DependenciesChangedEvent.class,
        editing = Editing.ENABLED,
        hidden = Where.NOWHERE,                                   // <2>
        notPersisted = false,                                     // <3>
        typeOf = ToDoItem.class                                   // <4>
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> can use no-arg constructor.
<2> default value, so could be omitted
<3> default value, so could be omitted
<4> default value, so could be omitted




[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/CollectionLayout.adoc[@CollectionLayout], xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc[@Property] and xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc[@PropertyLayout]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.
This is so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
