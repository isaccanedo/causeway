The xref:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#snapshot[snapshot()] element indicates whether the property should be included/excluded from any snapshots generated by the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/xmlsnapshot/XmlSnapshotService.adoc[XmlSnapshotService].

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Order {

    @Property(snapshot=EXCLUDED)
    @Getter @Setter
    private Order previousOrder;

    // ...
}
----

If the property is derived, then providing only a "getter" will also work:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public Order getPreviousOrder() {...}
    ...
}
----
