The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/ActionLayout.adoc#hidden[hidden()] attribute indicates where (in the UI) the action should be hidden from the user.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#hidden[@Action#hidden] to hide an action at the domain layer.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @ActionLayout(hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE)
    public void updateStatus() {
        // ...
    }
    ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
The action should be hidden at all times.

* `Where.NOWHERE`
+
The action should not be hidden.

The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.
