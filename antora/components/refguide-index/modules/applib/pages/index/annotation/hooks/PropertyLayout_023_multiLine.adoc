The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#multiLine[multiLine()] element  specifies that the text field for a string property should span multiple lines.
It is ignored for other property types.

If set > 1 (as would normally be the case), then the default xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#labelPosition[labelPosition] defaults to `TOP` (rather than `LEFT`, as would normally be the case).

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class BugReport {

    @PropertyLayout(
        numberOfLines=10
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private String stepsToReproduce;

    // ...
}
----

Here the `stepsToReproduce` property will be displayed in a text box of 10 rows.
