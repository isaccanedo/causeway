For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)             // <1>
    @ActionLayout(
        bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT,
        cssClass="x-key",
        cssClassFa="fa-checkbox",
        describedAs="Mark the todo item as not complete after all",
        hidden=Where.NOWHERE,                       // <2>
        sequence = "1"
    )
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> required for bookmarkable actions
<2> default value, so could be omitted


[TIP]
====
As an alternative to using the `@ActionLayout` annotation, a xref:userguide:ROOT:ui-layout-and-hints.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used (and is generally to be preferred since it is more flexible/powerful).
====

== Usage Notes

As alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:ROOT:ui-layout-and-hints.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can generally be used instead.
