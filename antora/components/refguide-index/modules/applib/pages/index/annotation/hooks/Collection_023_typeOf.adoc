The xref:applib:index/annotation/Collection.adoc#typeOf[typeOf] element specifies the expected type of an element contained within a collection when for whatever reason the type cannot be inferred from the generic type, or to provide a hint about the actual run-time (as opposed to compile-time) type.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;

public void Customer {

    @Collection(typeOf=Order.class)
    @Getter
    private SortedSet outstandingOrders = ...

}
----

In general though this element should not be necessary if you use generics for the return type, eg:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;

public void Customer {

    @Collection()
    @Getter
    private SortedSet<Order> outstandingOrders = ...

}
----
