The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc#autoCompleteRepository[autoCompleteRepository()] element nominates a single method on a domain service as the fallback means for looking up instances of the domain object using a simple string.

For example, this might search for a customer by their name or number.
Or it could search for a country based on its ISO-3 code or user-friendly name.

[TIP]
====
If you require additional control - for example restricting the returned results based on the object being interacted with - then use the xref:refguide:applib-methods:prefixes.adoc#autoComplete[autoComplete...()] supporting method instead.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    autoCompleteRepository=CustomerRepository.class
)
public class Customer {
   ....
}
----

where:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class CustomerRepository {
    List<Customer> autoComplete(String search);  // <1>
    ...
}
----
<1> is assumed to be called "autoComplete", and accepts a single string


(As noted above) the method invoked on the repository is assumed to be called "autoComplete".
The optional xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc#autoCompleteMethod[autoCompleteMethod()] element allows the name of this method to be overridden.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    autoCompleteRepository=Customers.class,
    autoCompleteAction="findByName"
)
public class Customer {
   ....
}
----

where in this case `findByName` might be an existing action already defined:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class Customers {

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    public List<Customer> findByName(
        @MinLength(3)                       // <.>
        @ParameterLayout(named="name")
        String name);
    ...
}
----
<.> end-user must enter minimum number of characters to trigger the query

NOTE: The autocomplete "action" can also be a regular method, annotated using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Programmatic.adoc[@Programmatic].
That is, it does not need to be part of the metamodel:
+
[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class Customers {
    @Programmatic
    public List<Customer> findByName(
        @MinLength(3)
        String name);
    ...
}
----
