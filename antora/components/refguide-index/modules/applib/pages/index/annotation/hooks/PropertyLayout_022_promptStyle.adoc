The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#promptStyle[promptStyle()] element is used to specify whether, when editing a domain object property, the new value for the property is prompted by way of a dialog box, or is prompted using an inline panel (replacing the property on the page).

If the attribute is not set, then the value of the xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.wicket.adoc#causeway.viewer.wicket.prompt-style[causeway.viewer.wicket.prompt-style] configuration property is used.
If this is itself not set, then an inline prompt is used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @PropertyLayout(
        promptStyle=PromptStyle.INLINE  // <.>
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private String notes;

    // ...
}
----

<.> prompt for the new value for the property using an inline panel
Note that the value `INLINE_AS_IF_EDIT` does not make sense for properties; if specified then it will be interpreted as just `INLINE`.
