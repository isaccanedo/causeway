The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#cssClass[cssClass()] element can be used to render additional CSS classes in the HTML (a wrapping `<div>`) that represents the property.
xref:refguide:config:application-specific/application-css.adoc[Application-specific CSS] can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem {

    @PropertyLayout(cssClass="x-key")
    @Getter @Setter
    private LocalDate dueBy;

    // ...
}
