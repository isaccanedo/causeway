== Examples

For example, a todo app could use `@HomePage` on a dashboard of todo items to complete:

image::refguide:applib-ant:reference-annotations/HomePage/HomePage.png[width="800px"]


The corresponding code is:

[source,java]
----
@HomePage
@DomainObject(nature = Nature.VIEW_MODEL)
public class TodoAppDashboard {
    public String title() { return "Dashboard"; }

    public List<ToDoItem> getNotYetComplete() { /* ... */ }
    public List<ToDoItem> getComplete() { /* ... */ }

    public Blob exportToWordDoc() { /* ... */ }  // <.>
}
----
<.> associated using xref:userguide:ROOT:ui-layout-and-hints.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] with the `notYetComplete` collection.

The other two actions shown in the above screenshot -- `exportAsXml` and `downloadLayout` -- are actually contributed to the `TodoAppDashboard` through various domain services, as is the `downloadLayout` action.
