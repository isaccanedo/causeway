Annotated on a view model to indicate that it should be used as the home page.

If - for the currently logged on user - none of the view model's members are effectively visible, (or if there are no members to begin with), the view model instance is considered hidden. Hence a NOT-AUTHORIZED page will be displayed instead.

The view model is instantiated through a no-arg constructor, so must in effect be stateless. Typically it will use injected repositories in order to display a dashboard, and offer actions to traverse or operate on the rendered state.
