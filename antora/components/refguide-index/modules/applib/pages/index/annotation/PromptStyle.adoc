== Members

[#AS_CONFIGURED]
=== AS_CONFIGURED

Prompt using the style configured by `causeway.viewer.wicket.promptStyle` .

If no style is configured, then _#INLINE_ is assumed.

[#DIALOG]
=== DIALOG

Use a dialog for the prompt.

This will be either modal dialog (same as if _#DIALOG_MODAL_ was selected) or sidebar (same as if _#DIALOG_SIDEBAR_ was selected) depending on the value of the `causeway.viewer.wicket.dialogMode` configuration property.

[#DIALOG_SIDEBAR]
=== DIALOG_SIDEBAR

Use a dialog for the prompt, rendered in a sidebar.

[#DIALOG_MODAL]
=== DIALOG_MODAL

Use a dialog for the prompt, rendered in a modal dialog.

[#INLINE]
=== INLINE

Show the form inline, temporarily replacing the rendering of the property.

[#INLINE_AS_IF_EDIT]
=== INLINE_AS_IF_EDIT

Applies only to actions, show the form inline, invoked as if editing the property.

Note that:

* Only one such action should have this attribute set per property. If there are multiple actions, then the first one discovered with the attribute is used.
* If the property is editable, then this attribute is ignored (and the action is treated as having a prompt style of _#INLINE_ ).
* If applied to a property, then the property's prompt style is simply treated as _#INLINE_ .

[#NOT_SPECIFIED]
=== NOT_SPECIFIED

Ignore the value provided by this annotation (meaning that the framework will keep searching, in meta annotations or superclasses/interfaces).
