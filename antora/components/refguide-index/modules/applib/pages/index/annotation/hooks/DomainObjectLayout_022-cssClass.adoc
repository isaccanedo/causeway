The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClass[cssClass()] element can be used to render additional CSS classes in the HTML (a wrapping `<div>`) that represents the domain object.
xref:refguide:config:application-specific/application-css.adoc[Application-specific CSS] can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
@DomainObjectLayout(
    cssClass="x-core-entity"
)
public class ToDoItem { /* ... */ }
----

[NOTE]
====
The similar xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClassFa[@DomainObjectLayout#cssClassFa()] element is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but in particular to allow http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons] to be rendered as the icon for classes.
