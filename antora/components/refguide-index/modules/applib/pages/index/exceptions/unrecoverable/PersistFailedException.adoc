Indicates that the persistence of an object failed.

This exception is intended to represent an unexpected and non-recoverable condition (eg a unique/primary key/ foreign key constaint has been violated), and so is a subclass of xref:refguide:applib:index/exceptions/UnrecoverableException.adoc[UnrecoverableException] . Throwing this exception will therefore result in (some sort of) error page being displayed to the user.
