Adapter to make it easy to perform boolean algebra on xref:refguide:applib:index/spec/Specification.adoc[Specification] s.

Subclasses represent the conjunction of multiple xref:refguide:applib:index/spec/Specification.adoc[Specification] s. An implementation should instantiate the xref:refguide:applib:index/spec/Specification.adoc[Specification] s to be satisfied in its constructor.

For example:

----
public class TeaOrCoffeeSpec extends SpecificationOr {
    public TeaOrCoffeeSpec() {
        super(new MustBeTeaSpec(), new MustBeCoffeeSpec());
    }
}
----

== API

[source,java]
.SpecificationOr.java
----
class SpecificationOr {
  SpecificationOr(Specification... specifications)
  String satisfies(Object obj)
}
