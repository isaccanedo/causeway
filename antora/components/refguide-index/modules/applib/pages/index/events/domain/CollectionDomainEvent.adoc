Fired whenever the framework interacts with a domain object's collection.

This is the specialization of xref:refguide:applib:index/events/domain/AbstractDomainEvent.adoc[AbstractDomainEvent] , for collections, * which should then be further subclassed by domain application. .

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework using a no-arg constructor; fields are set reflectively.

== Members

[#CollectionDomainEvent_]
=== CollectionDomainEvent()

Subtypes can define a no-arg constructor; the framework sets state via (non-API) setters.

[#CollectionDomainEvent_S]
=== CollectionDomainEvent(S)

Subtypes can define a one-arg constructor; the framework sets state via (non-API) setters.

A one-arg constructor is particularly useful in the context of non-static DomainEvent class nesting.
