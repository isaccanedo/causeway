Sets up a role for regular users of the security module.

These permissions are intended to be sufficient for most regular users to have access to the 'safe' features provided by the core framework (in particular, everything under the _CausewayModuleApplib#NAMESPACE causeway.applib_ namespace.

That said, it does _not_ include the ability to impersonate other users (for this, grant the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/role/seed/CausewaySudoImpersonateRoleAndPermissions.adoc[CausewaySudoImpersonateRoleAndPermissions] role), and also does _not_ include the ability to access the configuration properties (for this, grant the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/role/seed/CausewaySudoImpersonateRoleAndPermissions.adoc[CausewaySudoImpersonateRoleAndPermissions] role).

The permissions also provide the ability to lookup their user account using the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/user/menu/MeService.adoc[MeService] , and for viewing and maintaining their user details.
