Previously the `atPath` would have corresponded to the unique path of some particular xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/tenancy/dom/ApplicationTenancy.adoc[ApplicationTenancy] instance. However, this has now been generalized; the atPath is simply a string whose interpretation is application-specific (in particular by the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/tenancy/spi/ApplicationTenancyEvaluator.adoc[ApplicationTenancyEvaluator] SPI).

For applications that still wish to follow the original more specific design (that the `atPath` corresponds to a single xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/tenancy/dom/ApplicationTenancy.adoc[ApplicationTenancy] ), then the path can be interpreted according to the following table:

any object that is not tenanted (that is, its class does not implement xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/tenancy/dom/HasAtPath.adoc[HasAtPath] is accessible by any user (usual permission rules apply).
