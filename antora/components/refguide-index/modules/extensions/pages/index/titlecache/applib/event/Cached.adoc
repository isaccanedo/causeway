For classes whose title is to be cached, use _DomainObjectLayout#titleUiEvent()_ with a subclass of _org.apache.causeway.applib.CausewayModuleApplib.TitleUiEvent_ that implements this marker interface.

The cache configuration will by default be taken from _org.apache.causeway.core.config.CausewayConfiguration.Extensions.Titlecache_ , but if the xref:refguide:extensions:index/titlecache/applib/event/CachedWithCacheSettings.adoc[CachedWithCacheSettings] is implemented, then these defaults can be fine-tuned.
