[#getCalendarName_]
=== getCalendarName()

The name of the calendar to which this event belongs.

For example, an `Employee` might have a `employedOn` property, so the calendar name would be 'employedOn'.

If there is possibly more than one date associated with the entity, then use xref:refguide:extensions:index/fullcalendar/applib/Calendarable.adoc[Calendarable] instead.
