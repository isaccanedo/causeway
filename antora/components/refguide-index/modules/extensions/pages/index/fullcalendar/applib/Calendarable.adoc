[#getCalendarNames_]
=== getCalendarNames()

The names of unique 'calendar's provided by this object.

The 'calendar' is a string identifier that indicates the nature of this event.

For example, an event of a lease's `FixedBreakOption` has three dates: the _break date_ , the _exercise date_ and the _reminder date_ . These therefore correspond to three different calendar names, respectively _Fixed break_ , _Fixed break exercise_ and _Fixed break exercise reminder_ .

[#getCalendarEvents_]
=== getCalendarEvents()

The events associated with this object, keyed by their corresponding _#getCalendarNames() calendar name_ .
