This action is intended to be invoked with `Accept` header set to `application/xml;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/action-result;x-ro-domain-type=org.apache.causeway.schema.ixn.v2.InteractionsDto` 

The xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionoutbox/applib/spiimpl/ContentMappingServiceForOutboxEvents.adoc[ContentMappingServiceForOutboxEvents] will then serialize the resultant xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionoutbox/applib/restapi/OutboxEvents.adoc[OutboxEvents] view model into XML.
