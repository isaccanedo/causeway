// LATER

We also recommend you import a set of live templates.
These are used to add new methods to existing classes:

.Live templates
image::030-import-settings/050-live-templates.png[width="600px"]

The live templates have a prefix of either:

* `is` : for Apache Causeway domain objects
* `ju` : for JUnit tests
* `jm` : for JMock mocks or libraries

The live templates are also provided as a settings JAR file, namely *link:{attachmentsdir}/resources/intellij/causeway-settings-live-templates.jar[causeway-settings-live-templates.jar]*.
Download and import (as for the previous settings JAR files).
