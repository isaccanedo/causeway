// LATER

Next we recommend you import a set of standard file templates.
These are used to create new classes or supporting files:

.File templates
image::030-import-settings/040-file-templates.png[width="400px"]

The file templates are provided as a settings JAR file, namely *link:{attachmentsdir}/causeway-settings-file-templates.jar[causeway-settings-file-templates.jar]*.
Download this file.

Next, import using `File > Import Settings`, specifying the directory that you have downloaded the file to:

.IntelliJ Import Settings - Specify JAR file
image::030-import-settings/010-settings-import-jar.png[width="400px"]

Select all the categories (there should just be one), and hit OK. then hit restart.

[WARNING]
====
If importing into IntelliJ 2017.2.3 two categories are shown - "File templates" and "File templates (schemes)".
Select all the categories.

Apparently no categories are shown if importing into IntelliJ 2016.1.1 Community Edition (and perhaps other 2016 versions).
The file does import ok into IntelliJ 15.0.x, so we think this is a bug in the 2016 version.

The workaround is to extract the `.jar` file locally and copy the files into IntelliJ's `config` directory, somewhere in your home directory:

* Windows `<User home>\.IdeaIC2016\config`
* Linux `~/..IdeaIC2016/config`
* Mac OS `~/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC2016`
