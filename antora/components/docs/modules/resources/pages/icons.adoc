Most Apache Causeway viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface.
It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently.
Here are some open source icon sets for both personal and commercial use (though some require a link back to the authors website):

* http://icons8.com/[icons8] (free and commercial)
* http://thenounproject.com/[the noun project] (free and commercial)
* http://www.flaticon.com/[flaticon] (free)
* https://material.io/resources/icons[Google material design] (free)
* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Desktop_icons[GNOME/Tango icons] (free)


If you know of any others freely usable and easily accessible, let us know through the xref:docs:support:mailing-list.adoc[mailing list].
