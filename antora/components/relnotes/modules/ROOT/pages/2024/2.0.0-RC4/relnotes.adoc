This release is primarily a stabilization and bug fix release, although there are a small number of new features.

This release also brings deeper integration with Spring's transaction management, introducing a new xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/TransactionScope.adoc[] annotation for services (similar to the existing xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/InteractionScope.adoc[]).
This was done as a fix for link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3654[CAUSEWAY-3654].

It also fixed an annoying bug to ensure layout metadata is now all properly loaded during bootstrapping (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3579[CAUSEWAY-3579]).
