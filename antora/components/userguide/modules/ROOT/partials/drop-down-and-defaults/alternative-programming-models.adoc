If you define an action as a xref:mixins.adoc[mixin], then there are two other ways in which the supporting methods for parameters can be specified:

* using the name of the parameter (rather than its number)
* using a Java record (or static data class) to capture all the argument values, rather than separate parameters.

You may find that these alternatives make for more maintainable code.
Check out the xref:mixins.adoc[mixin docs] for more details
