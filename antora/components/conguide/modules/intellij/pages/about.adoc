== Code Style / Initial IDE Configuration

Additional configuration of IntelliJ for contributors (and committers).

* Recommended way to setup your editor is via `.editorconfig` file located at the project's very root, which requires IntelliJ integration for link:https://editorconfig.org/[editorconfig.org]. 
* As an alternative you can just set up the link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-Causeway-importorder.xml[import order].

== Prepare for Build

As a rule of thumb, you should:

* build the framework once outside of the IDE, using Maven
* in the IDE, open the project from the top-level `pom.xml`

Although not mandatory, you might also find it worth ignoring the `causeway-schema` module.
That's because this module uses a Maven plugin to generate code from XSDs, and sometimes the IDE might overwrite/remove these generated files.
