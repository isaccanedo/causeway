== Code Style / Initial IDE Configuration

Additional configuration of Eclipse for contributors (and committers):

* Recommended way to setup your editor is via `.editorconfig` file located at the project's very root. 
However, at the time of writing we could not find any Eclipse integration for link:https://editorconfig.org/[editorconfig.org],
hence an _import order_ configuration file `.editorconfig.eclipse.importorder` for Eclipse is provided (located at the project's very root).

Also:

* set up link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-code-style-formatting.xml[code formatting]
* set up the link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-code-style-template.xml[code style templates]
* set up link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-Causeway-code-style-cleanup.xml[code style cleanup]

== Prepare for Build

As a rule of thumb, you should:

* build the framework once outside of the IDE, using Maven
* in the IDE, open the project from the top-level `pom.xml`

Although not mandatory, you might also find it worth closing the `causeway-schema` module.
That's because this module uses a Maven plugin to generate code from XSDs, and sometimes the IDE might overwrite/remove these generated files.
