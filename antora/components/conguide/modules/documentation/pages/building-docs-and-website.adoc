The Apache Causeway website and documentation are written in link:https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc], using link:https://antora.org/[Antora] as a static website generator.

== Prerequisites:

The prerequisites to install are:

* Node LTS (link:https://nodejs.org/[])
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
----

* Antora (link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@antora/cli[@antora/cli] & link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@antora/site-generator-default[@antora/site-generator-default]), and Kroki (link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciidoctor-kroki[asciidoctor-kroki]) for diagramming support:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm i -g @antora/cli@^3.1.1 @antora/site-generator-default@^3.1.1 asciidoctor-kroki
----
+
See the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/[Antora docs] for details.

* Serve (link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve[serve]) for previewing:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm i -g serve@^13.0.2
----

We also generate some AsciiDoc files dynamically from other source code.
This requires:

* link:https://groovy.apache.org/download.html[Groovy 2.x]
+
eg, using link:https://sdkman.io/install[sdkman]:
+
[source,bash]
----
sdk install groovy 2.5.15
----

* link:https://pandoc.org/installing.html[pandoc]
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install pandoc
----

* dos2unix
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install dos2unix
----


== Authoring

To create/update documentation, we strongly recommend:

* IntelliJ link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[AsciiDoc plugin]
* IntelliJ link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15635-diagrams-net-integration[Diagrams.net plugin]

Even if you don't use IntelliJ as your primary IDE, it's worth using it for writing documentation - there's currently nothing as good as the AsciiDoc plugin on any other editor platform, especially when it comes to writing Antora.


== Build

The `preview.sh` script can be used to build the website, also calling the documentation tooling that automates documentation from code (the xref:core:_overview:about.adoc[System Overview], large parts of the xref:refguide::about.adoc[Reference Guide] and the xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration Guide]).

Use `preview.sh -h` to view options.
The lower case flags skip steps, while the upper case flags exclude all steps except those indicated:

* `preview.sh`
+
builds everything and serves up the site

* `preview.sh -AS`
+
runs only Antora generation and serves up the site

* `preview.sh -ekcdl`
+
does the same thing, by skipping the other 5 steps.

The script can be found at the root of this git repo.
