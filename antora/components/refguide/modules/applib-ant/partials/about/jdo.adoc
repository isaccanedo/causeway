The table below lists the xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] annotations currently recognized by Apache Causeway.

|xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc[@javax.jdo.annotations. +
Column]
|Used to determine whether a property is mandatory or optional.  For `String` and `BigDecimal` properties, used to determine length/precision/scale.

Discriminator]
|Infer the logical type name.
This takes precedence of `@PersistenceCapable` (below).
However, `@DomainObject#logicalTypeName` takes precedence over this.

|xref:refguide:applib-ant:NotPersistent.adoc[@javax.jdo.annotations. +
NotPersistent]
|Used to determine whether to enforce or skip some metamodel validation on nullability (`@Column` vs equivalent Causeway annotations).

|Domain / persistence
|Property


|xref:refguide:applib-ant:PersistenceCapable.adoc[@javax.jdo.annotations. +
PersistenceCapable]
|The `schema` attribute plus table name is used to the logical type name.
However, `@Discriminator` (above) takes precedence, as does `@DomainObject#logicalTypeName`.

Internally, it also flags that the class is an entity, creating an abstraction layer through which the Causeway framework interacts with the underlying persistent domain object.

|Domain / persistence

|xref:refguide:applib-ant:PrimaryKey.adoc[@javax.jdo.annotations. +
PrimaryKey]
|Used to ensure Apache Causeway does not overwrite application-defined primary keys, and to ensure is read-only in the UI.
