|SPI service for xref:security:spring:about.adoc[Spring Security] to convert a Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/Authentication.html[Authentication] into an Apache Causeway xref:refguide:applib:index/services/user/UserMemento.adoc[UserMemento].
