Every object is represented by a title.
This appears both as a main header for the object when viewed as well as being used as a hyperlink within properties and collections.
It therefore must contain enough information for the end-user to distinguish the object from any others.

This is most commonly done by including some unique key within the title, for example a customer's SSN, or an order number, and so forth.
However note that Apache Causeway itself does _not_ require the title to be unique; it is merely recommended in most cases.

An object's title can be constructed in various ways, but the most flexible is to use the `title()` method.
The signature of this method is usually:

[source,java]
----
public String title() {
    // ...
}
----

Note that Apache Causeway' xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[i18n support] extends this so that titles can also be internationalized.

For example, in a todoapp we can use this technique to change the title of items that have been completed:

[source,java]
----
public String title() {
    if (isComplete()) {                                         // <.>
        return getDescription() + "- Completed!");
    } else {
        final LocalDate dueBy = getDueBy();
        if (dueBy != null) {                                    // <.>
            return getDescription() + " due by " + dueBy);
        } else {
            return getDescription();
        }
    }
}

As the example above shows, the implementation can be as complex as you like.

In many cases, though, you may be able to use the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Title.adoc[@Title] annotation.
