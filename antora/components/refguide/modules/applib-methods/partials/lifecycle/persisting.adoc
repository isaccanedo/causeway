The `persisting()` lifecycle callback method is called when a (not-yet-persistent) object is just about to be persisted from the object store

An alternative means to interact with the lifecycle is by setting up a subscriber on the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc#persistingLifecycleEvent[@DomainObject#persistingLifecycleEvent()] event.
