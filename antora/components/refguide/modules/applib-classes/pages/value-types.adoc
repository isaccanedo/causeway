== Built-in

Apache Causeway can render and persist all of the JDK primitives and wrapper classes, and a number of other JDK (7.x) classes that represent value types.

It also supports some of the link:http://www.joda.org/joda-time/[Joda-Time] datatypes, and a number of value types that are shipped by the framework itself.

In addition to primitives, the JDK Classes supported are:

* the wrapper classes:

** `java.lang.Boolean`, `java.lang.Character`, `java.lang.Double`, `java.lang.Float`, `java.lang.Long`, `java.lang.Integer`, `java.lang.Short`, `java.lang.Byte`

* `java.lang.String`

* numeric data types:

** `java.math.BigDecimal`
** `java.math.BigInteger`

* date types:

** `java.sql.Date`
** `java.sql.Time`
** `java.sql.Timestamp`
** `java.util.Date`


== Joda Time

It also supports these Joda-Time classes:

* `org.joda.time.DateTime`
* `org.joda.time.LocalDateTime`
* `org.joda.time.LocalDate`



== Framework-defined

The framework also defines a number of custom value types:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Blob.adoc[Blob]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Clob.adoc[Clob]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Markup.adoc[Markup]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/LocalResourcePath.adoc[LocalResourcePath]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Password.adoc[Password]

In addition, there are a number of non-core value types that can be brought in individually.
These can be found in the catalog of xref:valuetypes:ROOT:about.adoc[Value Types].



== Custom value types

It is also possible to write your own value types, either scalar or composite.
For more on this topic, see xref:userguide:ROOT:value-types.adoc[value types] topic in the user guide.
