== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleSecuritySimple.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {

  @Bean
  public SimpleRealm simpleRealm() {
    return new SimpleRealm()
    //roles
    .addRole("admin_role", id->Grant.CHANGE)
    .addRole("order_role", id->
        id.getFullIdentityString().contains("Order")
            ? Grant.CHANGE
            : Grant.NONE)
    .addRole("customer_role", id->
        id.getFullIdentityString().contains("Customer")
            ? Grant.CHANGE
            : Grant.NONE)
    .addRole("reader_role", id->
        id.getFullIdentityString().contains("TopSecret")
            ? Grant.NONE
            : Grant.READ)
    //users
    .addUser("sven", pwdhash, List.of("admin_role"))
    .addUser("dick", pwdhash, List.of("reader_role", "order_role"))
    .addUser("bob", pwdhash, List.of("reader_role", "customer_role"))
    .addUser("joe", pwdhash, List.of("reader_role"));
  }
}
----

Make sure that no other `CausewayModuleSecurityXxx` module is imported.


== In Use

With security-simple installed, you should be able to login with credentials that are validated against the `SimpleRealm` as configured.

Password hashes should match the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder` that needs to be registered with _Spring's_ context.
