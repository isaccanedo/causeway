The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/sudo/SudoService.adoc[SudoService] provides the mechanism to run an arbitrary block of code, but changing the effective user executing the block, or the effective time that the block was run.

This is a general purpose capability, but is especially useful for fixtures.

== Mocking the Clock

It's sometimes necessary to change the effective time that a fixture or test runs.
This can be done by calling xref:refguide:applib:index/services/sudo/SudoService.adoc[SudoService] with an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] that has switched the clock.

For example:

[source,java]
----
val when = VirtualClock.nowAt(Instant.parse("2017-02-03T09:00:00.00Z")); // <.>

simpleObject =
    sudoService.call(
        InteractionContext.switchClock(when),                            // <.>
        ()-> fixtureScripts.runPersona(SimpleObject_persona.FOO)         // <.>
    );
----

<.> the effective time, in other words the date/time we want the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/clock/ClockService.adoc[ClockService] to report
<.> Unary operator on xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] to switch the effective time
<.> the block of code to run within this modified xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext].


== Switching the User ("Sudo")

Sometimes in our fixture scripts we want to perform a business action running as a particular user.
This might be for the usual reason - so that our fixtures accurately reflect the reality of the system with all business constraints enforced using the `WrapperFactory` - or more straightforwardly it might be simply that the action depends on the identity of the user invoking the action.
Either way, this can be done by calling xref:refguide:applib:index/services/sudo/SudoService.adoc[SudoService] with an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] that has switched the effective user.


For example:

[source,java]
----
val who = UserMemento.ofName("fred");                            // <.>

simpleObject =
    sudoService.call(
        InteractionContext.switchUser(who),                      // <.>
        ()-> fixtureScripts.runPersona(SimpleObject_persona.FOO) // <.>
    );
----

<.> the effective user, in other words the user that we want xref:refguide:applib:index/services/user/UserService.adoc[UserService] to report
<.> Unary operator on xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] to switch the effective user
<.> the block of code to run within this modified xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext].



== Mocking the Clock and the User

If we want to change both the effective time _and_ the effective user, then we just need to combine the ``UnaryOperator``s passed into xref:refguide:applib:index/services/sudo/SudoService.adoc[SudoService].

As a convenience, xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] provides a helper method for just this purpose:

For example:

[source,java]
----
val who = UserMemento.ofName("fred");
val when = VirtualClock.nowAt(Instant.parse("2017-02-03T09:00:00.00Z"));

val switchWhoAndWhen =
        InteractionContext.combine(
            InteractionContext.switchUser(who),
            InteractionContext.switchClock(when)
        );
----

This can then be passed in as the first argument to `SudoService`'s xref:refguide:applib:index/services/sudo/SudoService.adoc#call_UnaryOperator_Callable[call(...)] or xref:refguide:applib:index/services/sudo/SudoService.adoc#run_UnaryOperator_ThrowingRunnable[run(...)] methods.
