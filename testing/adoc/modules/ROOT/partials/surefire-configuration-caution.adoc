[CAUTION]
====
The xref:docs:parent-pom:about.adoc[Parent POM] configures the Maven surefire plugin in three separate executions for unit tests, integ tests and for BDD specs.
This relies on a naming convention:

* unit tests, which must have the name `\*Test*`, but excluding ...
* integ tests, which must have the name `\*IntegTest*`
* BDD integ specs, which must have the name `\*Spec*`

Classes named `\*Abstract*` are always ignored.

Not following this convention (intermixing unit tests with integ tests) may cause the latter to fail.
